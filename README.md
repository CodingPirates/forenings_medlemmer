This system is used by the union [Coding Pirates][cpdk], we are a volunteer
non profit that teaches programming, 3D printing, and other IT related
activities to kids.

We use this system to manage our unions, chapters, members, activities and
volunteers.

## The system

> The system is going through a redesign and thus the code is still between
> phases and thus a bit messy.

## Development
