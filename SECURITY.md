# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

At this time, the system runs only on members.codingpirates.dk - therefore we do not provide support for older versions than the current release.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability, we would like to know about it. ItÂ¨s important that we do it in a secure and responsible way, so we can fix the vulnerability.
You can send a secure mail to our codingpiratesmembersystem@proton.me - our core team will receive a message when you write here and will take action accordingly.

When we receive a message, we will assess the risk related to the incident, and fix it as soon as possible. We will take any necessary steps to ensure the safety and security of the system.
